# Decoder-Ring
This project consists of 3 different puzzle ciphers as a web page. 
It can viewed online and different messages can be inputted onto the web page.
Each puzzle has a different name and a different function that it peforms. 

Down below is a brief description of the 3 puzzles.

The first puzzle is called a Caesar Shift. 
The Caesar Shift is where the alphabet is shifted by a letter or by number. 
What you input can be shifted a different of number of times on the alphabet resulting in a coded message. 
The Caesar shift ignores capital letters and maintains spaces. 
 
The 2nd puzzle is called a Polybius Square. 
The Polybius Square is a cipher puzzle that uses a grid to encode or decode a message. 
The Polybius Square also ignores capital letters and maintains spaces.

The 3rd puzzle is called a Subsitution cipher. 
The Subsitution cipher can translate any phrase given for an input and will give a coded message. 
The cipher ignores capital letters and maintain spaces. 

This was an interesting project to work on and it was a lot of fun.
